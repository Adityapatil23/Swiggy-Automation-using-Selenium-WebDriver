# 🍽️ Swiggy Automation with Selenium WebDriver

This project automates the process of ordering food on [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com) using **Java** and **Selenium WebDriver**.  
It demonstrates real-world test automation scenarios like login (manual OTP), dynamic UI interaction, and navigation flow up to the payment page (no actual transaction).
